RISE - Standing Desk Extension
formmmeister by Nearby Minds UG
We specialise in Open Design, Location Based Marketing and in Innovation & Craft.

Why we created RISE...
We are not meant to sit.
Permanent sitting is one of the major potential threats to our health.
 
RISE is an feel-good standing desk and our alternative concept to permanent sitting.
RISE was designed by formmeister and makes every conventional desk a little healthier.

In times of mutual care, we would like to make our standing desk extension accessible to everyone who has the facilities to produce it.
